Evidence/WF.lean — the well-foundedness stage (self-contained, no mathlib)

(The import is on the first line: the kimina server used to verify this file
mis-splits a snippet whose `import` is preceded by a comment.)

WHAT THIS FILE IS FOR.  `Evidence/Cert.lean` builds certificate families by
recursion along the BM4 expansion.  Below ω² the recursion index is the pair
`(m, k)` of `cert_wm` and Lean's own `Prod.Lex` discharges termination.  One
level up the index is a VECTOR of counts, and Lean has no built-in order for
that, so the recursion needs a well-foundedness theorem of its own.  That is
what this file provides, in the form the certificate recursion actually
consumes.

THE ORDER.  A term of the CNF segment below ω^(k+1) is

    ω^k·c_k + ω^(k-1)·c_(k-1) + … + ω^0·c_0 ,

i.e. the vector `[c_k, …, c_0]`.  The BM4 expansion of such a term acts on the
lowest nonzero level j:

    j = 0 : successor, c_0 ↦ c_0 - 1
    j > 0 : limit,     c_j ↦ c_j - 1  and  c_(j-1) ↦ n+1   (the copy count)

Both steps leave the levels above j untouched and strictly decrease the entry at
level j, so both are instances of ONE lemma, `lexLt_at`: agree on a prefix, drop
at the next entry.  This is the Hydra/multiset ordering in the form that a fixed
level bound makes elementary — the bound is legitimate because no expansion step
ever raises the top level.

WHY THE LENGTH CONDITION IS IN THE `head` CONSTRUCTOR.  Lexicographic comparison
of arbitrary-length lists is NOT well-founded:

    [1] > [0,1] > [0,0,1] > [0,0,0,1] > …

is an infinite descent (each step compares 0 < 1 at the head, or equal heads and
recurses).  Requiring the two tails to have the same length in the `head`
constructor makes `LexLt` length-preserving, and then it is well-founded on ALL
of `List Nat` — no side condition at the use site.  `lexLt_wf` below.

SCOPE, HONESTLY (see also the design note at the end of Evidence/Cert.lean).

  * This is exactly what the certificate recursion for the region below ω^ω
    needs: the expansion steps are concrete, so `lexLt_at` + `lexLt_wf` supply
    the termination argument directly.  No statement about the T(M) order `lt`
    is required for that.
  * It is NOT the same thing as well-foundedness of `lt` itself on the inT terms
    below a bound.  That stronger statement is what the conditional main theorem
    MT wants, and it additionally needs the analytic direction of the order
    (inversion lemmas) plus transitivity of `lt`, neither of which is proved
    anywhere in this repository yet.
  * The method here does NOT scale to ε₀: below ε₀ the exponents are themselves
    unbounded terms, so no fixed level bound exists and there is no vector to
    put a lexicographic order on.  ε₀ needs the classical structural argument
    (`Acc a → Acc b → Acc (ω^a + b)`), which is where transitivity becomes
    unavoidable.

/-! ## §1 The lexicographic order on count vectors -/

/-- Lexicographic order on `List Nat`, compared from the left.  The `head` case
    requires equal tail lengths, which makes the relation length-preserving —
    without that condition it is not well-founded (see the header). -/

The standard proof: induction on the length; inside, induction on the head entry
(ordinary `Nat` recursion, strengthened to "for every `b ≤ a`"); inside that,
induction on the accessibility of the tail. -/

/-! ## §3 The step lemma the expansion uses

Both BM4 steps on a count vector — "successor: drop one unit" and "limit: drop
one ω^j and put `n+1` copies of ω^(j-1) below it" — keep the levels above `j`
and strictly decrease the entry at level `j`.  That is exactly `lexLt_at`. -/

/-- The limit step at level `j > 0`: one `ω^j` is replaced by `n+1` copies of
    `ω^(j-1)`, and everything below is cleared.  `r` is the (fixed-length) block
    of levels strictly below `j-1`. -/
